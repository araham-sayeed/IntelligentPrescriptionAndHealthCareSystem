# IntelligentPrescriptionAndHealthCareSystem

This paper presents a personalized healthcare pipeline that integrates OCR and NLP to extract medicine names from handwritten prescriptions, retrieve drug safety information, and predict diseases based on user-reported symptoms. Unlike prior approaches that focus solely on text recognition or symptom analysis, this system unifies both tasks into a coherent framework. It extends beyond basic OCR by matching extracted medicine names with a structured dataset and retrieving drug precau- tions via the RxNorm API. Although the RxNorm integration currently faces mapping challenges, it highlights the potential for incorporating drug safety checks into real-time systems. A rule-based engine predicts possible diseases based on symptoms using a structured CSV file. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate promising utility, laying the foundation for intelligent and scal- able telemedicine systems.
